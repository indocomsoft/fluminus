<sup><sub>F LumiNUS! IVLE ftw! Why fix what ain't broken?!</sub></sup>

If you are looking for the CLI tool, it has been refactored as a separate package: https://github.com/indocomsoft/fluminus_cli

Since IVLE will be deprecated next academic year (AY2019/2020), while LumiNUS has consistently pushed back its schedule to release an API, I have decided to reverse-engineer the API used by the Angular front-end of LumiNUS.

> Recall all the posts that complained about how slow LumiNUS is? Thatâ€™s an example of the difference between code that works and well-designed code that works efficiently.

As evident from the quote, LumiNUS is infamous for its slow speed (and in my opinion, ridiculous API). As such, for Fluminus, I try to keep to best coding practices and do things efficiently, such as HTTP connection pooling, ensuring that there is no O(n^2) algorithm, not creating requests for information that has previously been obtained, and only creating requests to the backend that are absolutely necessary (looking at you, LumiNUS Angular Frontend).

Do let me know if you have any suggestions!

PR's are welcome.

Note that this is created through reverse-engineering LumiNUS's Angular Frontend. The API might change at any time (although I doubt it since LumiNUS is using OpenID Connect)
